As an Associate Teaching Professor in the [Cognitive Science](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/) department at [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/), my primary focus is teaching data science, programming, and genetics to undergraduates. Teaching to and learning from students is the best part of my job! As such, I care deeply about providing my students with a technical education in an inclusive environment. And, while I have a whole lot of students, I do my best to ensure that they all receive the education they want, deserve, and are paying for.

#### Postdoc

I was a postdoctoral fellow in the [biostatistics department](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](http://www.jhsph.edu/), where I was fortunate to work with all the wonderful people in [Jeff Leek](http://jtleek.com/)'s group.

During my postdoc, I worked to develop the content for [DataTrail](https://www.datatrail.org/datatrail) (formerly Cloud-Based Data Science), a set of free, online courses to teach the basics of data science to individuls with no background in computing. The eleven course Course Set is available from [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/universities/set/jhu/cloud-based-data-science
). To supplement CBDS, I also helped to develop and implement CBDS+, an in-person tutoring and job placement program for historically underserved populations in Baltimore City. 

I also worked with the data in *[recount](https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount/)* to build predictors capable of [accurately predicting critical phenotype information from gene expression](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/46/9/e54/4920847), These predictions have been used to improve analyses and better understand expression in humans.

#### Grad School

I received my Ph.D. in human genetics from the [Institute of Genetic Medicine](https://igm.jhmi.edu/) at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  In [Dan Arking's lab](http://www.arkinglab.org/) I focused on improving our understanding of autism. To do this, I used post-mortem cortical brain samples from autism cases and controls to study alterations in [gene expression](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms6748) and [methylation](https://molecularautism.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13229-017-0119-y).

#### My Interests
   
I love **analyzing data carefully** and **teaching others** how to do the same! I'm always happy to talk about teaching, data science, all things R and Python, pedagogy, and genetics.

When I'm not busy analyzing data, cursing myself for a bug in my code, or teaching others how to do the same, I am always down to chat about beach volleyball, books, baking, biking, and great podcasts.
