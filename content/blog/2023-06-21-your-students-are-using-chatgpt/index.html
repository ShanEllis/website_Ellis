<p>I’m probably not the first to suggest that your students are using ChatGPT, but if you’re not yet convinced, I’m here to give you a glimpse into how frequently and in what ways your students may be using ChatGPT. This will be most pertinent to those teaching data science and/or programming courses, but I’d venture to guess much of it’s applicable in the humanities and elsewhere as well.</p>
<div id="tldr-summary" class="section level2">
<h2>tl;dr Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>60% and 72% of students in my large-enrollment data science and programming courses (respectively) reported using an AI-based LLM for school tasks</li>
<li>Daily use is not yet typical</li>
<li>Students more likely to perceive AI-based LLMs as supporting their learning than hindering it</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This past Spring term I taught two courses at UC San Diego: <strong><a href="https://cogs18.github.io/intro.html">COGS 18</a> Introduction to Python</strong> and <strong><a href="https://cogs9.github.io/ucsd-cogs9/">COGS 9</a> Introduction to Data Science</strong>. Very briefly, <strong>COGS 18</strong> is an intro-level undergraduate, programming course (think: CS1). The <em>vast</em> majority of students are either cognitive science or psychology majors, for whom this (or an equivalent programming course) is required. <strong>COGS 9</strong> is an intro-level, undergraduate survey course focused on introducing the concepts in data science to students while requiring reading, critical thinking, a deep consideration of ethics, and effective communication. This class is required of data science majors and minors; the majority of students are math, data science, economics, or cognitive science majors. This past term there were 345 students in COGS 18 and 295 students in COGS 9. In both courses, LLMs (like ChatGPT) were discussed in class and students were allowed to utilize them as a tool to support their learning throughout the term. In COGS 18, we had two in-class, closed-book exams where LLMs/the internet were not used/accessible.</p>
</div>
<div id="post-course-survey" class="section level2">
<h2>Post-course Survey</h2>
<p>At the end of the term, I included the same set of questions about students’ use of LLMs in their learning in both courses on their post-course surveys. Completing this survey was optional, but a small amount of extra credit was offered for completion. Before releasing the survey, I reminded students in class that ChatGPT <em>was</em> allowed in these courses and that I’m curious about their use and not trying to “catch” anyone; however, I’d imagine (as with all survey data) there would be some hesitancy in students responding with full honesty in some cases. In <strong>COGS 18, 223 students (64%) completed the survey; in COGS 9, 215 students did so (73%)</strong>.</p>
<p>In response to the question <strong>Have you used an AI-based LLM (i.e. ChatGPT or Copilot) for school tasks yet</strong> (either in COGS X OR another course)?, <strong>161 (72%) students responded “Yes” in COGS 18</strong>; <strong>130 (60%) responded “Yes” in COGS 9.</strong></p>
<p>Those who responded “Yes” were asked a number of additional questions, the responses to which are summarized/included below.</p>
<div id="how-often-do-you-use-chatgpt-or-a-similar-technology-for-schoolwork" class="section level3">
<h3>How often do you use ChatGPT (or a similar technology) for schoolwork?</h3>
<p>Of the students who <em>have</em> used ChatGPT for schoolwork, they vary in their frequency of use, as we see below. I’ll highlight that in a technical programming course (COGS 18), we see a slight shift to more frequent use. Of course there are many reasons why this could be the case - different students, different majors, etc. - but I’d venture to guess that in most programming courses, its use is pretty regular by a large fraction of students. I’ll also note we saw office hours attendance and online questions asked nosedive this quarter. Our best guess: students are getting their answers elsewhere…via AI-based LLMs.</p>

<h3>How do you think ChatGPT (or similar technologies) has helped you in your studies?</h3>
<p>When answering this question students highlight a lot of really great ways in which tools like ChatGPT can help them: clarifications, explanations, rewording/improving clarity of student writing, testing their work, removing anxiety, getting started, additional practice problems, explanations, quick access to information, etc.</p>

It helps my come up with concepts but I do the work.

<td style="text-align:left;">
It explains things in layman’s terms and breaks everything down in smaller steps whereas other study tools might skip steps or just give answers which doesn’t help with learning.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
There were times when doing either the lab or the assignments where I truly had no idea where to begin and ChatGPT helped me get started. Once I was given some help I would go back to my notes to try to understand the code or I would ask ChatGPT to explain something if I don’t understand. It was my first time using ChatGPT and it was a pleasant experience
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
I had trouble with one assignment when looking for the specific method that I needed to use. I think ChatGPT definitely helps when looking for and describing specific programming methods, libraries, or other modules that you’re looking for. While I haven’t used it for writing, I definitely think it could help provide the bones of an essay or paper, which would otherwise take hours to write.

<td style="text-align:left;">
Sometimes it can be hard to find answers from Google if my questions are too specific, but ChatGPT can get some of them right away

I can get some sort of explanation right away, instead of waiting.

<td style="text-align:left;">
ChatGPT was able to give me a neutral perspective on my work and guide me in the right direction if needed.

<td style="text-align:left;">
I think for some things it makes it easier to learn and for some it just does the problems for you, depends on how much I care
</td>

<td style="text-align:left;">
A lot, helped narrow searches
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
I think it is a great tool for simple things, but I would never use it for analytical work. I think professors should teach more about the flaws of chatgpt and how to check what chatgpt says as well as how to determine when it is wrong and what kinds of things you should/shouldn’t use it for. that being said, I frequently use it for things like cracking code errors if I’m at my wit’s end, rephrasing things, and brainstorming, but I think that students need to know that you need to do the work yourself first and have a good idea of where it’s going because it makes a lot of mistakes and can’t really do the heavy lifting.
</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
I think it’s a great thing to lean on when you need help and can’t get it anywhere it else, especially explaining concepts and topics comprehensively in one place.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
It has made it easier to access information, while also explaining concepts while giving answers
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
It has helped in a big way, because you don’t really need to scour Google or YouTube to find information on specific concepts anymore. I mainly use ChatGPT to get me on the right track when it comes to doing a problem, but I’ve never just told it to do a problem for me because it’s usually very wrong.

<td style="text-align:left;">
ChatGPT explains things pretty well and it is faster than Google.

<td style="text-align:left;">
It has helped expand on knowledge surrounding computers and programming in general

<td style="text-align:left;">
I think if I need to find an error I put my code in chat gpt and ask it to point out a typo or something else
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Yes, it helped explain concepts I needed more explanation for.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
I think it gives easy access to explanations and delivers it in a quick manner. Instead of going to office hours at perhaps inconvenient times, I can just paste my code into the application and ask why my code is not performing correctly.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
It would help clarify or gives me new ways to learn material
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
With every writing piece, I copy and paste it into ChatGPT and ask what I can improve and usually it gives me some solid ideas of what to revise or change. This is probably the biggest help I have found out of ChatGPT, as sometimes if you ask it to explain things it’s wrong.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
I personally have mainly used it to help me with readings in my history class! It helps me understand a certain portion or paragraph if I end up not understanding its significance, etc. Additionally, when it came to essays or writing prompts (for applications) it’s helped me with introductory paragraphs and grammar.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
I think ChatGPT has just helped me be more efficient. I use it for ideas and other things I would otherwise have to search the internet for a long time for. Like brainstorming essay topics and what not. In this class, I used it to help me solve coding problems that I couldn’t figure out after trying for a while and checking the lecture notes. If I still couldn’t solve a problem after that, I would ask ChatGPT to make me a similar example so I could see the concepts we needed in action and that would help me figure out what I needed to do.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
It has helped me better understand certain concepts and answered any questions I had
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
It helps explain topics in a different way. You can questions regarding a topic and it can provide you a lot if information to help you understand it better.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Honestly, I have seen an impact on learning with chatGPT, it has helped me get a deeper understanding of class topics when I needed it.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
It has helped me in checking my work for errors and/or to improve it
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
If I don’t understand what a module does, or if I keep running into errors, I use ChatGPT to check my logic/ code.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
It helps with identifying different errors and explaining how I can improve very clearly.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Gave me confidence in my own code, and helped me with troubleshooting if I encountered errors
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
I simply use it to double check my work so it takes a layer of anxiety away.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Has helped me check my understanding and make sure that I’m going on the right path
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
I think it was just a way for me to ask my questions. Even if it gave me the completely wrong answer I would try my best to use the answer if possible to find the error in my own code.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
It usually helps get me quick answers to simple questions. Sometimes with search engines, like Google, you have to scroll and click on multiple link to find what you are specifically looking for. ChatGPT is typically quick and accurate.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Whenever I was stuck or just needed inspiration, I used ChatGPT because the AI model is very good at explaining these concepts, providing examples of the code, and providing examples of how to implement and use the written code.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
It helped me confirm my understanding and tweak the few mistakes I would have in my code. This helped me enjoy the subject more since I felt like my grade wasn’t always in risk as I could catch some of my mistakes through chatGPT. Otherwise, I used it a few times when I was completely stuck to guide me in the correct direction alongside the help of practice problems from lecture notes. This allowed me to get more practice with the material as I figure out how they wrote the code versus how professor explained it in class.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
I struggle with asking questions when not in-person, I feel self-conscious, and ChatGPT allows me to ask questions/get clarification without feeling that.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
It helps to explain complex concepts in more simple terms, and I am able to have what’s basically a tailored lecture based on my questions and what I don’t understand.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
They helped me by explaining the process of solving or writing code.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
the first time i ever used chatgbt was in this class, and it helped because it not only gives you an answer to your question that you have but it provides detailed and sometime step by step explanations that can really help you understand the material.

<td style="text-align:left;">
I suck at interpreting instructions sometimes and chatGPT would help me to decipher instructions

<td style="text-align:left;">
Saved me time and allowed me to easier paraphrase long articles that I would have otherwise had to read.

<td style="text-align:left;">
It helped provide a solution with an explanation when I was stuck. From that point I was able to visually see what I did wrong and understood what it should look like in the future.
</td>

<td style="text-align:left;">
I think it has helped test my knowledge and I try to fact-check ChatGpt (for this class I would usually use stackoverflow and chatgpt and compare the two)
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Since terminology is heavy in CS, having access to everything labeled and defined for reference within the context of specific examples facilitates reading/speaking in CS terminology rather than having someone explain verbally and fluently assuming someone new to CS understands the terminology perfectly. Its simply more efficient, despite spending relatively more time on an assignment for more exposure to examples through ChatGPT

ChatGPT provided a step-by-step explanation for codes that didn’t make sense to me. It also helped me check my work.

especially for cog neuroscience class, there are a lot of concepts or ideas that are difficult to understand. I use chatgpt to make sure that I fully grasp the idea and the material I am supposed to know for the exam.

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
I think ChatGPT has helped my learning, as it is able to expedite the searching process for information, however I can see how it can be used to just complete work. I use it primarily to avoid wasting time searching and getting wrong information, with that said ChatGPT is also sometimes incorrect, so it is smart to use it as a tool, but not rely on it as a crutch.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
It is definitely very helpful in learning python, and it was my main tool used outside of the lecture notes. It also helps in other courses because a simple question is replied with a full explanation with information that helps give context to the problem I am working on.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
I think the most helpful thing that ChatGPT helps me is ChatGPT can let me know where and why I made a mistake, and also can explain to me or give me some solutions.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
I think it helped because if often pointed out mistakes I didn’t realize I was making, which saved a lot of time. It also helped me figure out where to start when I was stuck on certain things. It was also helpful because it explains everything to me in the moment, so it was easy to understand concepts that I was struggling on. It also saved a lot of time because I usually do my assignments at night when the TAs and professors are not available to answer my questions.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
In this class in particular I found this technology very helpful to my understanding. I sometimes have difficulty speaking up and asking questions in class so being able to have unlimited access for all of my questions makes understanding concepts a lot easier for me. I like being able to ask ‘stupid’ questions or asking it to explain concepts very simply/broken down that I normally wouldn’t ask another person.

It was almost like another teacher, harder to understand, but can teach way more an explain to the very small details so if you have patience with it, you can learn from it.
</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Yes. Sometimes I have an idea of what to say, but don’t know how to word it the way I want it, so ChatGPT gives me a better idea. I never fully copy from the site, but it does help me brainstorm more of my thoughts. In specific relation to COGS 18, it really helped me with writing code when I was a teensy bit off. I also used it to double check that my code was working as intended.

probably like explanations? like they good at giving you definitions concepts and such, and sometimes it great when u can paste code in chatgpt to check your work, i learn that chatgpt love to add stuffs so lots of the time it will give you more than you need which will not pass the assert or what the assignments demand, and sometimes it can make your answer more confusing like i paste my original code and it add more a bunch of stuffs, yet it good at giving you example and such

Good for quickly getting clarification on a specific question, especially for questions that are kind of complicated or wouldn’t get me very far in just the google search engine.

ChatGPT does a great job of summarizing a reading for me as it would list it all the main points for me. In addition, ChatGPT is also effective in creating outlines for topics you are interested in which can be a big help in starting things off in the write direction.

<h3>How do you think ChatGPT (or similar technologies) has limited your ability to learn?</h3>
<p>In response to this question, <em>many</em> students said that it has not limited their ability to learn. Others said that they’ve become too reliant on it, that they go to ChatGPT immediately rather than thinking on their own, that they accept generic responses too easily/limits creativity, and that it’s not always correct.</p>

I have to try not to use it so often. I don’t always use it to write code itself but because it is so easy to do so I have to refrain from using it for that sole purpose. I have now begun to try to use it more to just explain topics that I do not understand. However, I do believe that people can become dependent on it.

<td style="text-align:left;">
Since I have a strong philosophy of self-improvement, I don’t use it unless I’m truly stumped or the specific task I have to complete is solely based on tedium. That being said, avoiding struggles naturally makes solidifying knowledge more difficult.

If anything it has expanded it. When writing papers or code I would ask question that would not give me the exact answer but rather hints in the right direction. Thinking about the right questions to ask made me think harder about what it is I was trying to get out of my assignments, this process also helped in the future as well as I could replicate this process without ChatGPT.

ChatGPT is an easier way to get and fast forward our thinking a bit than the amount of time I would spend trying to figure out problems.

In the same way it gives quick access to help, it also can give quick access to answers. There’s always a bit of an underlying feeling that I can just get the answer, but I always have to remind myself I’m just cheating myself out of learning. It also reduces the amount of attempts I make before checking my answer. I’m glad I don’t have to dwell on a single problem for hours, but it sometimes reduces my motivation to make several attempts instead of just a few.

I think the way I use it, it didn’t limit my ability to learn. This is because before I even try using ChatGPT I try to find the answer on my own. I only use it as a last resort, when I feel that I’ve tried everything or when I’m just curious about how something works.

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>This is just a quick summary of what my students said in two courses in a single academic term at a single university in the US. It’s certainly not a deep-dive or rigorous study, but lots of people are working on or have already published these. For example, if you’re looking to read more about what people are thinking about when it comes to teaching computing with AI<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, considering whether AI is the new pair-programmer <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, or want to know more about how well these LLMs explain their code (in comparison to humans) <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, there is actual research out there. Given all of this, I’m excited to re-work my courses going forward to make better use of this new technology while continuing to try and figure out how to ensure my students are <em>actually</em> learning while teaching about ethics and fostering an environment where students act with integrity.</p>
